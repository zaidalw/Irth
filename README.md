2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser OR use a local dev server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code).
3. The app uses `esm.sh` for dependencies, so no `npm install` is required for basic local development.

## 📦 Deployment
This app is ready for **GitHub Pages**. Simply push the code to a `main` branch and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings. Ensure all file paths remain relative for the PWA to function correctly.
